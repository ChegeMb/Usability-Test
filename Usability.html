        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>We learned that this webssite has a lot to offer and so many variations of items for searching for.
            The current design is effect because it only takes a click of a button to find the item you are looking for.
            The website could add a feature of having age catagories where the search user can search for items based off their age and find what is popular for them.
